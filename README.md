**Summary:**

CaesarShiftCipher_v1.0.0_2019 is my implementation of an early Roman method of cryptography called the Caesar Shift Cipher. It works by shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number. The recipient of the message will shift the letters back by the same amount and will be able to obtain the original message.

**Operation:**

 - Run the project to start the application.
 - You will be prompted to select one of two modes, Encryption or Decryption
 - Each mode has been allocated a fixed number. 1 is for Encryption and 2 is for Decryption. Once you have decided which mode you want, type it into the terminal and press the Enter key on your keyboard.
 - Next you will  be prompted to enter a message string. Paste or type in the appropriate plain text or encrypted text, depending on which mode you have selected.
 - Finally, you will be prompted for a shift amount.
 - Once you have provided the program with everything it needs, it will either Encrypt or Decrypt the text and the result will be printed in the terminal window.
 

**TODO:**

 - The project currently only supports encryption of letters of the alphabet. I will expand to numbers and too later.
 - Main function needs refactoring
